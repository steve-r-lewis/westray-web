# Westray Community Web Application

**Bringing the island together — online.**

This project is a digital platform for the vibrant island community of **Westray**, one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Designed with the unique needs of small island life in mind, this web application provides a central online space for commerce, community, and collaboration.

## 🌊 Purpose

To create a digital commons where individuals, businesses, clubs, and local bodies can connect, share, and thrive — whether you're selling hand-knitted jumpers, organising a seaweed-foraging club, or announcing a village ceilidh.

## 🛍️ Features

- **Island Marketplace**  
  Residents can create their own online shops, list goods or services, and trade locally (or globally, if desired).

- **Community Profiles & Organisations**  
  Support for clubs, interest groups, and official bodies — each with their own space to post updates, events, and resources.

- **Social Feeds & Forums**  
  Open and private discussion areas for real-time updates, island gossip, serious debate, and everything in between.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Fully functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop — perfect for crofters and café dwellers alike.

- **Privacy-Conscious & Community-Owned**  
  Built with respect for user privacy and autonomy, and structured to be governed by the island itself.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** A vue.js powered Nuxt implementation (composition API with modern tooling)
- **Backend:** Currently either Appwrite or Google's Firebase
- **Modules:** Nuxt/Icons
- **Database(s):** Currently using the serverless provisions of either Google's Firebase suite or Appwrite.  Later, a microservices polyglot architecture may be deployed using a combination of MongoDB / MySQL / Neo4j (depending on context-specific needs)
- **Hosting:** To launch the project will be using the serverless backend technologies of Appwrite and Netlify or Google's Firebase suite.  Eventually, it is intended that a self-hosted or island-internal server capability will be used.
- **Other:** Support for offline-first operation and local resilience

## 🧭 Vision

This application is more than just code — it’s a tool to strengthen real-world relationships, foster economic resilience, and keep Westray’s culture alive in the digital age.
